---

Louane called on Eurecat binaural audio experts for the creation of the 8D version of her new single *Donne Moi Ton Coeur*. In collaboration with her artistic director Jim Zelechowski and her sound engineer Jeremie Tuile, Eurecat audio team has delivered a binaural version of her hit song, making it one of the very first success in binaural from the music industry.
<br />

Louane tells how she came to discover binaural audio:
<br />

**How did you discover 8D sound?**
<br />
I discovered the 8D sound thanks to Julien De Muynke, researcher of the Audiovisual Technologies Unit of Eurecat, who introduced me to it through your projects 3 years ago in your acoustic laboratory. He explained to me that Eurecat had 15 years of experience in the spatialization of sound and I had the chance to test the dummy head which impressed me enormously. I fell in love with this new listening opportunity immediately.
<br />

**What do you think the 8D sound brings to the song Donne Moi Ton Coeur?**
<br />
The 8D sound brings a new listening experience to the song. Donne Moi Ton Coeur in 8D is a new way to rediscover instruments and sounds played that you might not necessarily hear on the stereo version.
<br />

**How was the development of the song Donne Moi Ton Coeur en 8D carried out?**
<br />
We worked as a team with my artistic director Jim Zelechowski, my usual mixer Jeremie Tuil and your team composed of Toni Farran and Julien De Muynke, researchers the Audiovisual Technologies Unit of Eurecat, to get a precision and quality that is both impressive for the general public, but with a form of lightness and class. We worked very hard to be able to present a qualitative work that emphasizes both the spatialization and my voice.
<br />

**Did you take into account the characteristics of the 8D sound from the moment you composed the piece Donne Moi Ton Coeur?**
<br />
No, I didnâ€™t take into account the characteristics of the 8D sound when I created Donne moi ton coeur, which makes the technology all the more impressive because of its versatility and width. Your technology allows you to adapt very easily even if the music was not recorded from the beginning with the spatial characteristics.
<br />

**How do you see the future of 8D sound?**
<br />
I think that just as in the time of the transition from mono to stereo, we have experienced a kind of revolution in listening, and this is what the spatialization of sound promises: to project us into a future of more in-depth daily listening.
