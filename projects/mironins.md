---



Mironins is a several years project started in 2014 that originally aims to make the Fundació Joan Miró more attractive and accessible to the young public, by means of a transmedia storytelling and gamification about the artistic work of Joan Miró. In a first phase Mironins project gave birth to a [televised cartoon series](http://mironins.com/) starring tiny coloured characters called the 'mironins', with which kids can easily identify. In a second phase that started recently, the targeted audience has become wider: with a special focus on young public and families, the goal is now to attract to the museum the general public in greater proportion by designing interactive installations using the latest technologies, for the purpose of enriching the visitor experience.<br />

For this project, Eurecat collaborates with several companies and institutions from diverse domains in order to come up with a brand new museographic approach for enlightening the work of Joan Miró:
- The Fundació Joan Miró
- Eurecat, Centre Tecnòlogic de Catalunya
- Wildbytes
- Cornelius Films
- Soft For You
- Universitat Pompeu Fabra

The future visitor experience will bring together innovative installations combining Augmented Reality through tablets using latest advances in Deep Learning, binaural storytelling, video and light projections together with 3D audio, and paintings sonification. Mironins project is a great example of an interdisciplinary work at the crossroads of art and technology.
