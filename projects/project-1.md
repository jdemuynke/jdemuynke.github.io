  - Binaural audio
  - Ambisonics Room Impulse Response
summary: For BINCI project we developed a suite of plugins for mixing in binaural the audio guides content of some museums and cultural sites, plus an ambisonics player supporting head tracking for an enhanced visitor experience.

Several companies and institutions gathered together to form a consortium under the flag of BINCI:
- Eurecat, Centre Tecnòlogic de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain
- HEAD acoustics, Herzogenrath, Germany
- 3D Sound Labs, Paris, France
- Antenna International, London, United Kingdom
- Voodoopop Studios, Berlin, Germany

The plugins developed in BINCI project were used for creating the audio content in binaural of the audio guides of 3 cultural sites throughout Europe:
- Die Alte Pinakotheke, Munich, Germany
- La Fundació Miró, Barcelona, Spain
- StAndrews Castle, StAndrews, Scotland

For the storytelling of the audio guides to achieve a high level of realism and immersiveness, we aimed to reproduce the exact acoustics of the targeted sites by capturing the impulse response of the different rooms in Ambisonics, from different positions, including at different distances from the microphone's position. This led to a discretized cartography of the 3D reverberation of the room.<br />
Measurement campaigns of Ambisonics Room Impulse Responses were established in all sites mentioned above: some exhibition galleries and halls of Die Alte Pinakotheke and La Fundació Miró, as well as the different spots of StAndrews Castle: entrance porch, guard chambers, kitchen cellars, mine and countermine (underground tunnels), bottle dungeon.<br />
These measurement datasets were [published in Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1299894#.XSHGfNMzbMU) and subject to a [proposal of a new Convention of SOFA](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=19560) (Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics) presented at the 144th AES Convention in Milan, Italy in 2018.
