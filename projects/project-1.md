summary: For BINCI project we developed a suite of plugins for mixing in binaural the audio guides content of some museums and cultural sites, plus an ambisonics player supporting head tracking for an enhanced visitor experience.

The plugins developed in BINCI project were used for creating the binaural content of 3 cultural sites throughout Europe:
- Die Alte Pinakotheke, Munich, Germany
- La Fundaci贸 Mir贸, Barcelona, Spain
- StAndrews Castle, StAndrews, Scotland

For the storytelling of the audio guides to achieve a high level of realism and immersiveness, we tried to reproduce the exact acoustics of the targeted sites by capturing the impulse response of the different rooms in Ambisonics, from different positions, including at different distances from the microphone's position. This results in a discretized cartography of the 3D reverberation of the room.
This led us to set up measurement campaigns of Ambisonics Room Impulse Responses in all sites mentioned above: some exhibition galleries and halls of Die Alte Pinakotheke and La Fundaci贸 Mir贸, as well as the different spots of StAndrews Castle: entrance porch, guard chambers, kitchen cellars, mine and countermine (underground tunnels), bottle dungeon.
These measurement datasets were [published in Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1299894#.XSHGfNMzbMU) and subject to a [proposal of a new Convention of SOFA](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=19560) (Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics) presented at the 144th AES Convention in Milan, Italy in 2018.
