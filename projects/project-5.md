At Talkartive I'm the audio guy, in charge of the mixing. Our podcasts feature both 3D audio in-situ recordings and extra sounds spatialized in post-production. I try to take advantage of the latest trends and tools in 3D audio technology for offering the most realistic experience to our listeners.
