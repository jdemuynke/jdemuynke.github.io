After many years of practice of the piano and the bass guitar in music bands, particularly playing versions of soul and funk music, I discovered the world of Brazilian music a few years back. I opened a tiny door that had remained closed until then and I discovered a whole musical universe.<br />

Where to start from? Maybe with a pioneer and essential album released in 1959 that defined the principles of a brand new music style at the time called bossa nova: Chega de Saudade by João Gilberto. Remarkable by the beauty of its melodies and the sobriety of João's interpretation, it is often considered as the first bossa nova album. Co-authored by Antônio Carlos Jobim, Vinícius de Moraes, Ary Barroso and many more, it features beautiful tracks like ["Chega de Saudade"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUuJrpP0Mak), ["Desafinado"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6w3a2v_50U), ["Hó-Bá-Lá-Lá"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKy6NJO8GPQ), ["Bim-Bom"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JVi6iAQpJg) and ["Brigas, Nunca Mais"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDs0rh3UTgc).

Another masterpiece of Bossa Nova is the soundtrack of the movie Orfeo Negro directed by Marcel Camus in 1959 and primed with La Palme d'Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival. It is based on the play Orpheu da Conceição by Vinícius de Moraes, itself an adaptation of the Greek legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, set in the modern context of a favela in Rio de Janeiro during Carnaval. The soundtrack was created by Antônio Carlos Jobim, whose song ["A Felicidade"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izlxyBOpuO4) opens the film; and Luiz Bonfá, whose ["Manhã de Carnaval"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVkDfnGobmI) and ["Samba de Orfeu"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnInVmowNu8) have become classics of bossa nova.

Brazilian music has a immense variety of styles and influences, among which one can mention the choro, whose one of the greatest composers was Pixinguinha who composed ["Carinhsoso"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IhqXDQkWpQ), and the samba popularised by many musicians including Baden Powell who was one of the most prominent Brazilian guitarists as proven by his interpretation of ["Samba Triste"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSUNbvb-DWg), or Cartola who wrote some gems like ["Preciso me encontrar"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUjOfsoBhMY).
